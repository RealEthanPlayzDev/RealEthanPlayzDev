## About Me
Hello, my name is RadiatedExodus, I am previously known as RealEthanPlayz, I have known about Roblox at 2015 and first made my account at 2016, I started scripting around 2016-2017 when I got interest in Roblox experience development. At this point currently I am still learning C++, C, and the Lua(u) C API.

Notes to consider:
+ I have the rights to decline your request
+ I am not good in things that involves CFrame or mathematics. (I can try but cannot gurantee, if I fail I will refund)
+ You must pay half of the agreed price first, then if you are satisfied after the work is done, you must pay me first and then I will send the work.
+ I only accept group payments. Gamepass is also an option however you must also pay the tax.
+ I can work in both Studio or filesystem (Rojo) environment.

<summary>Meta Script Builder</summary>

Experience link: https://www.roblox.com/games/6588310761/

Meta Script Builder is a experience similar to others like Void Script Builder, it features:
+ Sandboxed script execution environment (albeit I admit it does need some work)
+ Output capturing (does not capture external required modules)
+ Execution on both serverside and clientside
+ Anti-destructible gui, other players cannot easily make the experience unusable by deleting the in-experience gui or such

<summary>Maze Generation</summary>

Experience link: https://www.roblox.com/games/7425009431/

Maze Generation is a game about mazes with no exit, the maze is different for every server as it generates a new maze everytime a server starts. This experience is also based on a [open-source community module](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/dungeon-generation-a-procedural-generation-guide/342413)

<summary>BloxExecutor (private)</summary>
BloxExecutor is a private serverside executor that I personally use in script builders, albeit I will not list the features as the work itself is private, it does offer a lot of features that are normally not available at free ss require executors that you can find on YouTube.

![image|690x475, 75%](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RealEthanPlayzDev/RealEthanPlayzDev/main/RobloxPortfolioAssets/BEv3.png)

However, the first version of the executor is open-sourced and available (please keep in mind my code style has changed a lot from when I made it the first time)

<summary>The Fun Mayhem: Legacy Mayhem</summary>

Experience link: https://www.roblox.com/games/5648964782/

The game's original release date: April 13 2020 (the experience link above does not match the original release date because [it got banned once](https://www.roblox.com/games/4893304290/) due to something I had implemented, this is also where I learned a lot of things about scripting, the experience is more like a hangout place for me and my friends (as we do not know what to play these days at Roblox), however it is long abandoned, a rewrite is currently being done inplace albeit I have been slacking off lately.

<summary>get whatsapp car drip-ed</summary>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_N1rnO80Nc

I'm ashamed for providing this aswell, but it's way too notable so here we go...
This was based on the "WhatsApp car drip meme", so I decided to make this, and then only to found out that there was a similar script and I got atleast 2 hate comments saying that I copied this...

Extra credits:
[@Ra1ph_YT](https://www.roblox.com/users/813606512/profile) - Providing the car in the script (he is also my friend)

Extra notes:
- The script is not designed for trolling public servers in script builders, it's intention is not to be abused to ruin other's fun at a experience, that is why I never shared the source of the script.

GitHub repository: https://github.com/RealEthanPlayzDev/RigConverter

This is a Roblox module to convert a player's character appearence between R6 and R15, 2 notable implementation notes it that for thr R15 conversion, it uses ``Players:CreateHumanoidModelFromUserId()`` so this is essentially the exact same default R15 character of the player's character appearence and they also retain animations, and things such as humanoid health regeneration, walking/jumping sounds, ability to jump are restored.
